# MarkAble
 
I've decided to open source this software as I'm no longer in a position to maintain it. It's written in C#. Please note that I can't assist with your implementation on your own system other than wish you good luck! It requires you to have Apple's iTunes for Windows installed, as it depends on controlling iTunes to do its work.

MarkAble is designed  for audiobook listeners who own an Apple iPod or iPhone, or who use iTunes to  listen to such books. Or podcast listeners wanting to be able to  combine and bookmark their saved files.

Audiobook files bought from the iTunes Music Store or  from Audible.com are ‘bookmarking’ - that is, the iPod / iPhone (or iTunes)  remembers the point of the book where you were up to, and resumes from  there when you start listening again. This, of course, is vital.

However, there are many other sources of audiobooks. Such books may be in a variety of different formats such as MP3 files (for example, from podcasts, www.audiobooksforfree.com), or audio CDs or tapes you may have bought. MarkAble makes it easy to merge a large number of tracks or individual files into a few files which will bookmark on your iPod or iPhone.
